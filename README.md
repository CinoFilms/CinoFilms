CINOFilms Frontend - CINO – Reward Best Film Projects !


CINO is a platform that allows amateur and professional filmmakers to obtain funds for cinematographic works.

## The Platform
The platform is based on Steem's blockchain and is divided into three main sections: Films, Trailers, Ideas.
 

The three sections will contain products already made (Films), projects that already have a trailer (Trailers) or ideas (Ideas) demonstrable through story boards or any other proof of. 
Each content is uploaded uniquely from the CINO main profile and can be voted by the visitors of the platform and by the internal sponsors of Steem who decide to support the project.


## Platform General Users

It is possible to subscribe to the Cino platform through a steem account. However, access will be limited to users with a minimum of pre-established Steem Power.
(in future releases it will be possible to make a monthly subscription payment in FIAT currency)



## Content Ideas Proposal

Each filmmaker will be able to have his own content or his own idea through a specific form present within the platform itself, which will indicate the type of content and details related to the project, such as description, cast, proponent team.
 


## Content Uploads
A selection process will be carried out, and all the selected contents will be loaded into the CINO platform through the central profile linked to it. The node service offered by IPFS (as done by the Dtube platform) has been taken into consideration as a content upload system.

 


## Reward For Content Creators and Stake Holders
(it’s possible to have a deeper understanding from the excel file attached)

Any content uploaded to the platform via the central profile will be voted using the typical Steem mechanism. Once the 7 days necessary for completion have passed the rewards of each content will be distributed according to these percentages:
-	Content Creators: 45% of the premium in SBD converted into current currency (€ or $) and turned by CINO directly to the creators of content..
-	Stakeholders: 25% of the premium in SBD, of which 50% to internal steem stakeholders (according to the internal percentage of participation) and the remaining 50% to external stakeholders in steem. 
-	CINO: 30% of the premium in SBD - 100% of the reward in SP
The reward for curation (not currently calculable) has a high probability of being distributed to the internal stakeholders of the platform, which will be the first to vote for the contents of the platform.

## Film Festivals
Film Festivals involved in the project will act as a catalyst for quality contents and will offer their brand to support the project. For this reason they will receive a 3% percentage on the rewards of the content creators. At the moment we have the institutional support of the Giffoni Innovation Hub, a company section of the Giffoni Film Festival dedicated to innovative projects.

## Internal Stakeholders
The internal steem stakeholders will be all those high-SP profiles that will want to participate in the project by joining the CINO Voting Trail, which will automatically vote with the 100% of the VP of members the contents made by CINO. For this they will receive a fixed percentage as indicated in the table above. They will also receive the curation reward (which can not currently be calculated).

External Stakeholders
Stakeholders external to steem will be all those investors who want to participate in the project by investing sums of money that will be immobilized in Steem Power that will be accumulated within the central profile of CINO. They will also receive a fixed percentage as indicated in the table above.
